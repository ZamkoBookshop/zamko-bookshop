### Exactly how to paste & commit (so nothing goes wrong)
1. In your repo, click **README.md** → click the **✏️ edit** icon.  
2. Select all existing text and **replace** with the content above.  
3. Scroll down to **Commit changes**: leave the default commit message (e.g., `Update README.md`) and **Commit directly to the `main` branch**.  
4. Click **Commit changes** (green button).  

---

### Quick checks after commit (confirm success)
- On the repo main page you should see the README rendered (shop name, address, etc.).  
- The file list should show `README.md`.  
- If anything looks off, tell me and I’ll paste a corrected version.  

---

### Next (I’ll stay with tiny steps)
Once you finish this README replace, say **“README updated ✅”** and I’ll give you the next *single* file (the `package.json`) already double-checked. I’ll continue giving just 1–2 files at a time so it never feels confusing.

If you want, I can also:
- Paste the `package.json` now (ready for you to create via **Add file → Create new file**), or  
- Prepare a ZIP of the whole project (you can upload at once) — I’ll guide you through that upload step-by-step.

Which would you like next? (If unsure, I recommend **package.json next** — quick and simple.)
